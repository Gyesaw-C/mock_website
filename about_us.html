    <p>The Club is firmly based on the beliefs and principles established by Gichin Funakoshi (1868-1957)</p>
    <p>The priciples the Shotokan School is based upon the details below:</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Never forget: karate begins with rei and ends with rei 
      (Rei means courtesy or respect, and is represented in karate by bowing)</p>
    <p>There is no first attack in karate <br>
    Karate supports righteousness <br>
    First understand yourself, then understand others <br>
    The art of developing the mind is more important than the art of applying technique <br>
    The mind needs to be freed <br>
    Trouble is born of negligence / ignorance <br>
    Do not think karate belongs only in the dojo <br>
    Karate training requires a lifetime <br>
    Transform everything into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness <br>
    Karate is like hot water, if you do not give it heat constantly, it will again become cold water <br>
    Do not think that you have to win, rather think you do not have to lose <br>
    Transform yourself according to the opponent <br>
    The outcome of the fight depends on one's control <br>
    Imagine one's arms and legs as swords <br>
    Once you leave the shelter of home, there are a million enemies <br>
    Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural positions <br>
    Perform the kata correctly; the real fight is a different matter <br>
    Do not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body and the speed of the technique <br>
    Apply the way of Karate to all things. Therein lies its beauty.</p>
